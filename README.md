### Suggestions

If you plan to write resources for others to use, please bear in mind:

- Can it be printed?
  - PDF is a good solution to this
- Can it be printed in black-and-white or photocopied?
- Can people easily modify to fix mistakes or make small changes to suit their own purposes? Providing source (markdown, Word document, etc as well as PDF is helpful)
- Is the language and terminology used easy for young people or beginners to understand?
- Have you included a "what you will need"?
  - This should include additional hardware, software installation, internet access required, etc.
  - Can this only be done on Pi 2/3 but not 1 or Zero?
  - Are there any pre-requisites the Jam organiser may need to know (like installing software or downloading files)
- Other people may not have the same setup you do (e.g. is something specific like pi-top proto board or black hat hacker assumed?)
  - Try to make as general as possible
